      "1004293:1 We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.\n",
      "1004293:2 They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.\n",
      "1004293:3 The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.\n",
      "1004293:4 After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.\n",
      "1004293:5 Avoid this place!\n",
      "1014458:0 I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.\n",
      "1014458:1 Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.\n",
      "1014458:2 The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.\n",
      "1014458:3 The wine list is interesting and has many good values.\n",
      "1014458:4 For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.\n",
      "1016296:0 I was very disappointed with this restaurant.\n",
      "1016296:1 Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.\n",
      "1016296:2 I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.\n",
      "1016296:3 Food was okay, nothing great.\n",
      "1016296:4 Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. \n",
      "1016296:5 I/we will never go back to this place again.\n",
      "1028246:0 Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!\n",
      "1028246:1 Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!\n",
      "1028246:2 You can't go wrong here.\n",
      "1032695:0 Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.\n",
      "1032695:1 Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.\n",
      "1032695:2 I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.\n",
      "1032695:3 Can't wait wait for my next visit.\n",
      "1041457:0 I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.' \n",
      "1041457:1 And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. \n",
      "1041457:2 The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.\n",
      "1041457:3 The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.\n",
      "1041457:4 I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).\n",
      "1041457:5 Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.\n",
      "1041457:6 The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.\n",
      "1053543:0 We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.\n",
      "1053543:1 What's the difference between the two?\n",
      "1053543:2 Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!\n",
      "1053543:3 The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!\n",
      "1053543:4 We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!\n",
      "1055910:0 we love th pink pony.\n",
      "1055910:1 THe perfect spot.\n",
      "1055910:2 Food-awesome.\n",

      "1055910:4 Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.\n",
      "1055910:5 Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.\n",
      "1058221:0 i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.\n",
      "1058221:1 (i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..) \n",
      "1058221:2 the food is decent.\n",
      "1058221:3 however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n",
      "1058221:4 i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.\n",
      "1058221:5 i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.\n",
      "1058221:6 well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. \n",
      "1058221:7 the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.\n",
      "1062641:0 This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.\n",
      "1062641:1 I had a great experience.\n",
      "1062641:2 Food is great.\n",
      "1062641:3 Service is top notch.\n",
      "1062641:4 I have been going back again and again.\n",
      "1064477:0 I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.\n",
      "1064477:1 It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.\n",
      "1064477:2 The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.\n",
      "1064477:3 The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.\n",
      "1064477:4 We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.\n",
      "1074868:0 I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.\n",
      "1074868:1 She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.\n",
      "1074868:2 Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.\n",
      "1074868:3 In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.\n",
      "1074868:4 The food was well prepared and the service impecable.\n",
      "1074868:5 I'm going back.\n",
      "1084394:0 Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.\n",
      "1084394:1 Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.\n",
      "1084394:2 The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.\n",
      "1084394:3 The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).\n",
      "1084394:4 I will be going back and heartily recommend it!\n",
      "1086415:0 I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.\n",
      "1086415:1 It is terrific, as is the value.\n",
      "1086415:2 $6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.\n",
      "1086415:3 I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.\n",
      "1086415:4 Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.\n",
      "1086415:5 Go hungry and enjoy.\n",
      "1086478:0 The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.\n",
      "1086478:1 I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.\n",
      "1086478:2 The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.\n",
      "1086478:3 The kitchen however, is almost always slow.\n",
      "1086478:4 Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.\n",
      "1086478:5 The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.\n",
      "1090587:0 Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.\n",
      "1090587:1 If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.\n",
      "1090587:2 Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.\n",
      "1090587:3 The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.\n",
      "1102681:0 Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.\n",
      "1102681:1 This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.\n",
      "1102681:2 The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.\n",
      "1102681:3 However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!\n",
      "1118167:0 I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.\n",
      "1118167:1 IT WAS HORRIBLE.\n",
      "1118167:2 The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!\n",
      "1118167:3 It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.\n",
      "1118167:4 I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.\n",
      "1119578:0 This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.\n",
      "1119578:1 The pizza is overpriced and soggy.\n",
      "1119578:2 Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.\n",
      "1119578:3 A big disappointment, all around.\n",
      "1123262:0 I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.\n",
      "1123262:1 The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.\n",
      "1123262:2 The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.\n",
      "1123262:3 Worth the trip from Manhattan.\n",
      "1125006:0 Was there Friday night.\n",
      "1125006:1 Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.\n",
      "1125006:2 And I've been to many NYC delis.\n",
      "1125006:3 My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.\n",
      "1125006:4 Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.\n",
      "1125284:0 As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.\n",
      "1125284:1 This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.\n",
      "1125284:2 The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.\n",
      "1125284:3 This place is worth an one-hour drive.\n",
      "1125284:4 I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.\n",
      "1126814:0 Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.\n",
      "1126814:1 My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.\n",
      "1126814:2 Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter.\n",
      "1126814:3 Decent wine at reasonable prices.\n",
      "1126814:4 Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.\n",
      "1126814:5 Our teenage kids love it, too.\n",
      "1126886:0 Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.\n",
      "1126886:1 This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.\n",
      "1126886:2 The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.\n",
      "1126886:3 You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.\n",
      "1126886:4 I'm partial to the Gnocchi.\n",
      "1131595:0 This place is incredibly tiny.\n",
      "1131595:1 They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.\n",
      "1131595:2 The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.\n",
      "1131595:3 The food was bland oily.\n",

      "1138996:1 We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.\n",
      "1138996:2 We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.\n",
      "1138996:3 As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.\n",
      "1138996:4 When we sat, we got great and fast service.\n",
      "1138996:5 The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.\n",
      "1138996:6 Make sure you try this place as often as you can.\n",
      "1145510:0 This is a fun restaurant to go to.\n",
      "1145510:1 The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.\n",
      "1145510:2 But the pizza is way to expensive.\n",
      "1145510:3 A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.\n",

      "1147082:1 Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.\n",

      "875139:5 I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.\n",
      "875139:6 The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol\n",

      "957145:3 I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!\n",

      "CLF#3:28 By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!\n",

      "BG#5:6 I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).\n",

      "DBG#2:6 However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.\n",
      "DBG#2:7 Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations.\n",
      "DBG#2:8 My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.\n",

      "DBG#7:9 The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.\n",
      "DBG#7:10 The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.\n",

      "Z#6:2 Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.\n",
      "Z#6:3 If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).\n",
      "Z#6:4 It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!\n",
      "Z#6:5 My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!\n",
      "Z#6:6 I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.\n",
      "Z#6:7 We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.\n",
      "Z#6:8 Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.\n",

      "Z#6:11 The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.\n",
      "Z#6:12 For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.\n",
      "Z#6:13 Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.\n",
      "Z#6:14 I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.\n",

      "CLF#4:1 I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.\n",
      "CLF#4:2 Moving on.\n",
      "CLF#4:3 If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.\n",
      "CLF#4:4 Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.\n",
      "CLF#4:5 The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.\n",
      "CLF#4:6 Well...they can run but they can't hide.\n",
      "CLF#4:7 I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.\n",
      "CLF#4:8 Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.\n",
      "CLF#4:9 However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.\n",
      "CLF#4:10 This place...god where do i begin.\n",
      "CLF#4:11 It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.\n",
      "CLF#4:12 The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!\n",
      "CLF#4:13 How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.\n",
      "BHD#4:0 Great Hot Dogs!\n",
      "BHD#4:1 I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).\n",
      "BHD#4:2 Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.\n",
      "BHD#4:3 The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!\n",
      "BHD#4:4 Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!\n",
      "BHD#4:5 Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.\n",
      "BHD#4:6 But nonetheless--great spot, great food.\n",
      "BFC#7:0 Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – \n",
      "BFC#7:1 We live nearby BFC. \n",
      "BFC#7:2 It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. \n",
      "BFC#7:3 Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. \n",
      "BFC#7:4 As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!\n",
      "BFC#7:5 The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. \n",
      "BFC#7:6 I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she \"had a BBQ to go to\" that night - WTF??\n",
      "BFC#7:7 I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!\n",
      "BFC#7:8 There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6\" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. \n",
      "BFC#7:9 I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. \n",
      "BFC#7:10 Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.\n",
      "BFC#7:11 Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. \n",
      "BFC#7:12 So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...\n",
      "ADLT#6:0 Maitre-D-\"Eat and get out\"\n",
      "ADLT#6:1 My family ate here last weekend.\n",
      "ADLT#6:2 The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.\n",
      "ADLT#6:3 While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.\n",
      "ADLT#6:4 This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.\n",
      "ADLT#6:5 His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.\n",
      "ADLT#6:6 A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of \" table turnover\", as whacked as it is, or else.\n",
      "ADLT#6:7 If you go here, do it on his off-night.\n",
      "NP#9:0 Best meal in a long time!\n",
      "NP#9:1 Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.\n",
      "NP#9:2 I had the Lamb special which was perfect.\n",
      "NP#9:3 My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.\n",
      "TFS#2:0 The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.\n",
      "TFS#2:1 The food is great and the environment is even better.\n",
      "TFS#2:2 Everyone must come here at least once.\n",
      "TFS#2:3 Highly recommend it!\n",
      "BHD#8:0 Taking Hot Dogs to the next level\n",
      "BHD#8:1 At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.\n",
      "BHD#8:2 Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.\n",
      "P#3:0 Great Atmosphere\n",
      "P#3:1 Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.\n",
      "P#3:2 I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.\n",
      "P#3:3 Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.\n",
      "CLF#8:0 Poor service and management\n",
      "CLF#8:1 Don’t go to this place!\n",
      "CLF#8:2 Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.\n",
      "CLF#8:3 Appetizers took nearly an hour.\n",
      "CLF#8:4 When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.\n",
      "CLF#8:5 Never got an explanation as to what was going on.\n",
      "CLF#8:6 The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.\n",
      "CLF#8:7 When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.\n",
      "CLF#8:8 On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.\n",
      "CLF#8:9 Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.\n",
      "ADLT#11:0 What a hassle!\n",
      "ADLT#11:1 The food is very good, but not outstanding.\n",
      "ADLT#11:2 There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.\n",
      "ADLT#11:3 On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.\n",
      "ADLT#11:4 Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.\n",
      "ADLT#11:5 Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.\n",
      "WE#1:0 Expensive\n",
      "WE#1:1 I went there after hearing how great it was.\n",
      "WE#1:2 Wow.\n",
      "WE#1:3 The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.\n",
      "WE#1:4 The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.\n",
      "WE#1:5 I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far.\n",
      "FF#6:0 So rude!!!\n",
      "FF#6:1 I went with JWILS.\n",
      "FF#6:2 Her review is above.\n",
      "FF#6:3 I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.\n",
      "FF#6:4 My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.\n",
      "FF#6:5 The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.\n",
      "FF#6:6 The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.\n",
      "FF#6:7 I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.\n",
      "FF#6:8 I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, \"can I help you\" and \"how many are in your party.\"\n",
      "FF#6:9 What?\n",
      "FF#6:10 The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.\n",
      "FF#6:11 We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.\n",
      "FF#6:12 Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.\n",
      "FF#10:0 bad staff\n",
      "FF#10:1 I generally like this place.\n",
      "FF#10:2 The food is good.\n",
      "FF#10:3 The design of the space is good.\n",
      "FF#10:4 But the service is HORRID!\n",
      "FF#10:5 I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.\n",
      "FF#10:6 The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.\n",
      "FF#10:7 I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!\n",
      "FF#10:8 The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).\n",
      "FF#10:9 I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.\n",
      "FF#10:10 She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.\n",
      "FF#10:11 I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.\n"
